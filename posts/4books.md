## TLDR

- **The Passionate Programmer** by Chad Fowler 
- **Just for Fun: The Story of an Accidental Revolutionary** by Linus Torvalds
- **Fight Night** by Miriam Toews
- **A truce that is not peace** by Miriam Toews

I took a week long vacation with my girlfriend and my family, where I basically did nothing but drink rum and cokes and read. I read 2 non fiction books, taken out from the library. Then I read Miriam Toews' novel 'Fight Night', followed my her memoir 'A truce that is not peace'.

Here's a brief reflection on each of them.
## Nonfiction
### Just for Fun: The Story of an Accidental Revolutionary 
This book is a sort of light hearted trip down memory lane for Linus, wherein he gives us a taste of the nostaligia for the early days of personal computing, open source development and overall geek culture. The book really doesn't give you much in terms of technical details, but is moreso evoking the imagery of what it'd be like to be a brilliant mind writing your own operating system. It was neat to read about Finish university culture at the time, and it brought back some warm and fuzzy memories of my experience living in a dorm during my undergrad. This book is pretty readable, and quick enough that I'd say it was overall worthwhile. Anyone vaguely interested in the open source software movement, Linux and software development in general will probably get a bit of kick out of it. 

If I was to really split hairs (over a book I didn't know existed until I saw it at my local library), I would point out that he does embelish in a bit of adorkable-geekisms in terms of talking about sex and relationships. This is pretty much harmless in isolation, so maybe I'm just being a dingus, but I do think the adorkable tone of storytelling that we see all around popculture is a) lame and b) not really discernable from plain-old jocky mysogony. He isn't weaponizing this much at all though, and I am certainly not questing whether he is in fact a geek, so I'll just tell myself that my hatred for The Big Bang Theory is tinting my vision here. 

### The Passionate Programmer
This is a Pragmatic Programmer esque, early 2000s techy inspo pump up book, full of kinda generic but usefull tips for software professionals. It's very nostalgic of a pre-AI, early 2000s optimistic outlook on technological meritocracy. Definetely the kind of book that would've made someone drink the 'work harder be smarter' koolaid that was generally true at the time. I made notes as I read it, not to tear on the book at all but to document the things I should implement into my own career and life. Like with all self help and career-inspo type books, you sort of know all this stuff already, but its packaged together neatly and articulated along with anecdotes and 2000s jokes that really get you going as you're reading it. 

Here's the book's points that registered with me and might give you the gist:
- The whole book returns to a metaphor of mastering your craft as a musician would. Think whiplash, but for compilers. This is a useful metaphor. Got me fired up about picking  up practicing guitar again too which is funny.
- lead or bleed: both ends of the adoption spectrum have opportunities. The guy retiring legacy system and the lady who knows some gnarly WASM thing both have opportunity to thrive
- supply and demand: "You can't compete on price, but you can compete on ability'. Here he's saying that competing for in demand skills isn't the only option. Competing for a less in demand skill let's your skill shine through more. Think of the billion 'full stack' devs competing for an entry level position, compared to the like 5 people competing for a systems programming job requiring you to know what a pointer is.
- Coding Don't Cut it Anymore: Basically you should have an interest or pretend to have an interest in the business side of whatever sector you work in or want to work in. 
- Be the Worst: This is the self-help thing of be the worst in the room/surround yourself with people better than you/you're the average of the 5 people closest to you thing. His call to action here is to volunteer on an open source project, join a developer group and overall just surround yourself with people as fired up as you about improving as a programmer.
- Invest in your intelligence: Some stuff + go try learning a new language just for the sake of it. 
- Don't Listen to your parents: this part is like a reflection on how our fears can interfere with our progression. Then he somehow connects that to the GitHub founder's "i gave up on a jajillion dollor salary to go start my genius thing" thing. That said, I do think if a recruiter asked me right this second to do something really cool I'd have a knee-jerk fear of change response that I want to analyze. 
- Be a generalist: He's encrouaging the reader to broaden their skillset by just knowing the smallest bit about all the technologies they use. He gives an anecdote about how many developers don’t know how to set up a development or deployment environment and that kinda clocked me. So I am going to act on that, at work and in my personal projects. 
- Be a specialist: “Unfortunately, the software industry has churned out a whole lot of these shallow specialists, who use the term specialist as an excuse for knowing only one thing.” Call to action: learn how the vm/compiler/interpreter/build system/libraries of your language works. He also tells the reader to teach a class on some aspect of technology that you would like to develop some depth in.
- Don't put all your eggs in someone else's basket: don't daydream about knowing a company's proprietary thing, but rather the underlying tech/concepts.
- Love it Leave it: This is another sort of call to finding people passionate about this stuff. He also taps into the obsessed musician metaphor here. Made me check out John Coltrane which is cool. He tells the user to log your excitement to go to work for the next 2 weeks each day, and reflect on that as you will at the end. This, I am doing already.
- Investing in your product: This touches on a recurring theme I forgot to mention earlier, which is that you should frame all this stuff as like "you are a business" and here's what to do to grow the business and blah. This chapter was about intentionality though and resonated with me. He reflects on how he's improved more as a musician who practices super intentionally, as opposed to however he was doing it (even when he was a professional musician). “the structured me who invests in his abilities (even as a hobby) completely wipes the floor with the me who bets it all on natural talent and ability”
- Learn to fish: basically master git, understand the internals of your language choice ever so slightly. Call to action: spend those little 5 min chunks learning something about something you use every day.
- Learn how businesses really work: basically do like a mini mba quick dive and ask your boss how your company's business model actually works.
- Find a mentor: ... by mentoring yourself? He gives the reader a system for mentoring yourself whereby you discover what your true priorities are by cmoparing the things you admire about someone to how you think that person would score your ability in that thing. The bigger that difference, the higher the priority.
- Be a mentor: learn by teaching blah. He talks about Martni Fowler who tells people to write about something to learn about it.
- Practice Practice Practice: more music metaphor, with a lesson per music practice thing list. Physical coordination translates to learning the different paradigmns of your language (network programming, testing, libs, regex, multithreading etc). Sight reading translates to just go read the source code of a tool you use and contribute to a TODO in that project. Improvisation was a forced metaphor of like using structures/constraints to your advantage.
- The way you do it: if you want to feel you own a process, help implement it. 
- On the shoulders of giants: mine existing code for insights, use existing code to reflect on your own capabilities, and go listen to John Coltrane. His call to action here is to go read a project like a book, makes notes about it and publish those notes to a blog or something. He also suggests to do a code-study with some like-minded people once a month, where each person breaks down 2 to 200 lines of code. This idea is a banger.
- Automate yourself into a job: just go automate something you do everyday,
- Right Now: He's again telling you to take advantage of those little moments throughout the day to do something intentional.
- Be a mind reader: This is a anecdote/advice combo chapter where he describes this guy he worked with who would basically write features before the managers even asked for it. I do this at work alot and I think it's sound advice. 
- Daily Hit: Have an accomplishment to report everyday. 
- Be where you're at: Basically don't be a gossiper/opportunistic ladder guy. Don't gossup or be a bullshitter. 
- A pebble in a bucket of water: He kind of describes how even someone 'irreplaceble' can be replaced and to track what you do at work. 
- Learn to love maintenance
- Eight hour burn: basically just actually do work, at work. Timeblock, work less, get more done. Be intentional.
- Learn how to fail: Basically be sincere/mature when you fuck something up. Take ownership when you do, and offer a solution. This is good advice in general. You'd be suprised how slippery people get with the truth when they get called out for messing something up, even if it's super minor. 
- Say No: this is boilerplate 'learn to say no' stuff, but he gives a tip I thought was cool which is to keep a commitment book. I am going to do this. I keep a calendar, a diary and a todo list but a straight up repository of what people expect of you because you said you'd do something is cool.
- Write/Network/Socialize: See if someone would think you're a jerk if they googled you.
- Release your code: basically he tells you to go refactor the sparse testing suite of some open source project and get those changes accepted. 
- Making the hang: Basically talk to someone you'd be too scared to talk to normally.
- Already obsolete: carve out time to investigate the bleeding edge weekly.

My fingers are getting tired. I'm gonna fire off the names of a few chaptes that I took notes on but don't care to do rn: Path with no destination, make yourself a map, become an alpha geek, value rigity, avoid waterfall career planning

- better than yesterday: make a list of the person or professional improvements you’d like to make. For each item in the list, think about what you could do today to make yourself better that yesterday. Then assess the next day, and repeat. Do this 2 mins each day — i could add this to my morning gratitude or my rating of how excited thingy.

So that's the list of chapter names and the lil points I took from some of them. Most of the points that really resonated with me are related to finding like minded people and discussing stuff with them, and I've added some commitments to my resolutions accordingly. 

Overall a nice, chill read to get fired up about going back to work in the new year. 
five out a seben.

## Fiction
### Fight Night
This was the second novel by Miriam Toews that I have read and it is probably my favorite novel I have read in a long time. The novel follows a child, her pregnant mother, and her ancient yet witty grandmother. They way Miriam Toews is able to completey immerse the reader, even through stream-of-consciousness 1st person style from the persepective of a 10 year old girl is just so impressive to me. 
As an aside, I read **A Truce That is Not Peace** after this and it was really neat to see just how directly her own life was breathed into the characters of **Fight Night**. 
This novel reminded me so vividly of the women in my life too. I saw elements of my mother and of my sister in Swiv's mom. The grandma is basically my gandma, and most jarringly, I resonated with alot of Swiv's intense emotions and behaviors. The experience of reading this book was like revisiting forgotten memories of my own family, accesible only due to the masterful narration and perseptive given to us by Toews. 
Super exceptional beautiful blast! 10/10

### A Truce that is Not Peace
So this was my third time spent with Miriam Toews' writing, and was read immediately following reading Fight Night. It'll probably be the last of her books I read for a little while too. Her life story reminds me of alot of really intense periods of my own life, which are best revisited only so often. This book is a memoir, a collection of letters, and reflections, in which Toews' talks about family, her relationships, the losses of family members to suicide, art, parenting, love and sorrow. 
It'd be faster to just point you towards it than to dive into it. If you're up for a gut punch and to be confronted with some heavy feelings, go read it. 
It was really lovely to read about suicide/pain/depression in a non stoic context, to actually talk about those things and think about them without the podcast-stoic-koolaid man kicking the wall down to tell you he's unbothered by the endless cruelty of living.
