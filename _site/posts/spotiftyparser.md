Scenerio: I like listening to a varitety of music. Many songs and bands come from places that don't speak English. Some of those places use different letters/alphabets/written language systems. 

In this scenario I have just found some band I like, that is a Chinese band whose band and song names are written in Mandarin.

I would like to be able to tell my friend 'Hey, I just found this new band ___ ', but I cannot do that without knowing how to pronounce it, which I cannot do unless I can copy paste that artist/song name into Google Translate and have that say it to me out loud.

The insanely frustrating aspect of this whole dilemna is that you cannot copy paste artist or song names from Spotify Desktop. If you try to drag-click them into your broswer, you see something like "https://open.spotify.com/track/1fmoCZ6mtMiqA5GHWPcZz9", as opposed to any readable text about the artist or song. 

Problem: How do I figure out who these people are if I cannot copy-paste that artist or song name straight from the Spotify desktop app? 

Solution: We need to turn that link into a copy-pastable string so that the tiny number of people upset with this flaw can move on with their lives.
