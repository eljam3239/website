Scenerio: I like listening to a varitety of music. Many songs and bands come from places that don't speak English. Some of those places use different letters/alphabets/written language systems. In this scenario I have just found some band I like, that is a Chinese band whose band and song names are written in Mandarin.
Problem: How do I figure out who these people are if I cannot copy-paste that artist or song name straight from the SPotify desktop app?
