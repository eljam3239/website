Sometime in the summer after my freshman year, I started vaping on a whim, and thus began a 6 year dependence on nicotine. Over time I alternated between vaping, cigarettes and nicotine pouches.
Shortly after the new year, I bought a final pack of cigarettes, smoked 2 of them, and gave the rest away. I haven't had any nicotine since. 

Just a few days ago, I celebrated 3 months without nicotine.
